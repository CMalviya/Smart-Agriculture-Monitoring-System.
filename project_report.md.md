## 1. Introduction  
Smart agriculture is an emerging field that uses technology to improve farming efficiency.  
This project implements a **basic Smart Agriculture Monitoring System** using simple Python programming concepts.  
The program simulates sensor readings (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity) entered by the user and provides recommendations for better crop management.

## 2. Problem Statement  
Farmers often struggle to make timely decisions due to lack of real-time information on soil and environmental conditions.  
A simple decision-support tool can help farmers take quick actions and improve crop health.

## 3. Objectives  
- To simulate a basic smart agriculture environment.  
- To take user inputs as sensor values.  
- To analyze conditions using simple decision logic.  
- To generate crop-care recommendations.  
- To reinforce programming concepts like input, conditions, and decision-making.
